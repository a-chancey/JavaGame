# JavaGame
Basic command line java "game" I did for practice, including a string reverser, a number adder and a tool to 
tell you if the number you entered was a prime number or not.


# Usage
The binary is included in /target, however, you can build yourself via maven with mvn clean install

Run the program using "java -jar target\javaGame-1.0-Final.jar"

You can escape any of the three games by typing "esc"

Enter 4 from the main menu to quit
